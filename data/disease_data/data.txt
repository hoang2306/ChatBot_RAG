Treatment plans can vary depending on your symptoms and the type of cardiovascular disease you have. Cardiovascular disease treatment may include:

Lifestyle changes: Examples include changing your diet, increasing your aerobic activity and quitting smoking or tobacco products (including vaping).
Medications: Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to help manage cardiovascular disease. Medication type will depend on what kind of cardiovascular disease you have.
Procedures or surgeries: If medications aren’t enough, your healthcare provider may use certain procedures or surgeries to treat your cardiovascular disease. Examples include stents in your heart or leg arteries, minimally invasive heart surgery, open-heart surgery, ablations or cardioversion.
Cardiac rehabilitation:You may need a monitored exercise program to help your heart get stronger.
Active surveillance: You may need careful monitoring over time without medications or procedures/surgeries.
Prevention
How can I prevent cardiovascular disease?
You can't prevent some types of cardiovascular disease, such as congenital heart disease. But lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of many types of cardiovascular disease.

You can reduce your cardiovascular risks by:

Avoiding all tobacco products.
Managing other health conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol or high blood pressure.
Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.
Eating a diet low in saturated fat and sodium.
Exercising at least 30 to 60 minutes per day on most days.
Reducing and managing stress.

Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, personal health and family health history. They may also order tests to help diagnose cardiovascular disease.

What tests might I have for cardiovascular disease?
Some common tests to diagnose cardiovascular disease include:

Blood work measures substances that indicate cardiovascular health, such as cholesterol, blood sugar levels and specific proteins. A provider can use a blood test to check for blood clotting issues as well.
Ankle brachial index (ABI) compares the blood pressure in your ankles and arms to diagnose peripheral artery disease.
Electrocardiogram (EKG) records your heart’s electrical activity.
Ambulatory monitoring uses wearable devices that track your heart rhythm and rates.
Echocardiogram uses sound waves to create an image of your heartbeat and blood flow.
Ultrasound uses sound waves to check blood flow in your legs or neck.
Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) uses X-rays and computer processing to create 3D images of your heart and blood vessels.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create highly detailed images of your heart.
MR angiogram or CT angiogram uses an MRI or CT, respectively, to see blood vessels in your legs, head and neck.
Stress tests analyze how physical activity affects your heart in a controlled setting, using exercise or medications, to determine how your heart responds. This type of test can involve EKGs and/or imaging tests.
Cardiac catheterization uses a catheter (thin, hollow tube) to measure pressure and blood flow in your heart.

Some respiratory diseases are acute, like an infection that will get better with treatment, while others are or become chronic and need to be managed.

Many types of lung diseases can cause chronic respiratory conditions. Chronic respiratory disease affects millions of people in the United States alone. It can be difficult to say how many people have lung diseases overall because these diseases are grouped into specific conditions.

Many genetic and environmental factors can lead to lung disease, but smoking is the top preventable cause of many respiratory conditions.

This article will look at the eight most common respiratory diseases, their symptoms, and what causes them.

Asthma
Asthma affects 25 million people in the United States. People with a family history of asthma, respiratory allergies, or severe childhood respiratory illness are at a higher risk of developing asthma.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes breathing problems when the airways become narrowed by inflammation or blocked by mucus. The condition’s severity varies from person to person, but most people take daily preventive medication to control their symptoms and prevent flare-ups.

Symptoms
Asthma can have several symptoms, including:

Wheezing
Coughing
Tightness in the chest
Shortness of breath
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term used to describe two primary types of obstructive lung disease that used to be classified separately: emphysema and chronic bronchitis.2

Emphysema develops when the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and less elastic. This reduces the ability of the sacs to move oxygen and other gases between the air that is breathed in and the blood. This can lead to a lack of oxygen in the blood (hypoxia) and a buildup of toxic waste products.
Chronic bronchitis is a condition where the lining of the bronchial tubes becomes irritated and inflamed. The swelling can make it more difficult to breathe and cause an overproduction of mucus.
Nearly 15 million people have been diagnosed with COPD in the United States, and another 12 million are believed to have the disease but do not have an official diagnosis.

COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. About eight in 10 cases are linked to exposure to cigarette smoke.

Symptoms
The symptoms of COPD vary based on which type you have. Common symptoms can include:

A frequent or chronic cough
A cough that produces a lot of mucus
Wheezing
A squeaking or whistling sound when you breathe
Shortness of breath that is worse with activity
Tightness in your chest
Sensitivity to respiratory infections like colds or the flu
Weight loss
Weakness
Swelling in your legs and feet
A blue tinge to your lips or fingernails (cyanosis)
Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that affects about 35,000 people in the United States. It can cause both breathing and digestive problems because the disease makes the mucus in the body very thick.

While the disease can involve several organs, it tends to cause specific problems in the lungs, such as blockages from thick mucus that trap harmful bacteria and lead to infections.

A diagnosis of CF is usually made early in life because newborns in the United States are screened for the disease. If a diagnosis is not made at birth, symptoms that occur in childhood can lead to the diagnosis later on.

Symptoms
Since cystic fibrosis can affect many parts of the body, a wide range of symptoms can develop, such as:

A cough that does not go away
A cough that produces thick mucus or blood
Wheezing
Shortness of breath
Frequent respiratory or sinus infections
Nasal polyps
Slow growth in childhood or poor weight gain
Constipation
Greasy or foul-smelling stools
Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, ranking third in the United States with more than 218,000 people affected.4 It can develop as either small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer, which is the more common of the two.

Cigarette smoking—both direct and secondhand—is one of the biggest risk factors for lung cancer.

Symptoms
Lung cancer can develop gradually and often with no symptoms. When it does appear, symptoms may include:

Chest pain
Chronic cough
Difficulty breathing
Wheezing
Hoarseness
Weight loss
Fatigue or weakness
Difficulty swallowing
A cough that produces bloody mucus
Swelling in the face or neck
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. More than 1.8 billion people around the world have tuberculosis, but the disease is only considered active in 10 million of them.

People with strong immune systems sometimes carry an inactive form of the disease, called latent tuberculosis. In people with weaker immune systems, the bacteria attacks lung tissue. It can also spread and cause damage to other parts of the body.

Symptoms
Many respiratory diseases share symptoms, such as long-term cough. Certain symptoms are specific to one disease or another. For example, night sweats tend to occur in people with tuberculosis.

Other tuberculosis symptoms include:

A cough that lasts longer than three weeks
Weight loss
Poor appetite
A cough that brings up blood or mucus
Weakness
Fatigue
Fever
Night sweats
Bronchitis
Bronchitis is a condition that develops when the windpipe (bronchial tube) gets irritated or inflamed. In response to the inflammation, the lining of the bronchial tube may make too much mucus as it tries to coat the area. The mucus can make it difficult to breath.

Inflammation can also cause swelling of the airway. This will cause it to narrow and makes it harder to breathe.

Bronchitis can be acute or chronic. There are some key differences between the two forms:

In acute bronchitis, the inflammation is usually caused by an infection that will get better in a few days to several weeks.
With chronic bronchitis, the inflammation is caused by repeated exposure to irritants—like cigarette smoke or pollution. Chronic bronchitis does not go away. You may have periods of relief along with periods where it gets worse (exacerbations), especially if you get a cold or another respiratory infection
Symptoms
Chronic bronchitis falls under the umbrella of COPD. Acute bronchitis is not considered COPD, but it shares symptoms with the chronic form of the disease. These symptoms include:
